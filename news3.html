                A little boy from the outskirts of a city on the continent of Asiania, one day was adopted by a great martial arts master. He practiced until he reached the SHANG level, the highest level at the age of 21. Until in time he has a weapon of his own, rather, a weapon that chooses its master. A scepter with shining precious stone chose him. The scepter eventually became known as the GREENERACT SPECTRE. He is said to be the strongest human on his era who has the ability to expel the demon race from the earth. One day, he was hunting with his favorit pet, LEVIA. He accidentally touches a wormhole under a waterfall, takes him to a different dimension and takes time to adjust to freezing, and finally found by a student in a learning center. Immediately find him in the CHI-SHANG map! He likes someone equals to him to be a friend.
